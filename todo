More tasks:

- add a try/catch when guessing inside "solve()"
- when a queen guess fails, block that cell

- add a check to fail the solve branch if a non-queened group is fully blocked
- maybe don't bother caching free-counts, to simplify code
- use 4 types of groups (add neighborhoods), try to regularize
	the code, add links from each cell to the 4 groups it determines
