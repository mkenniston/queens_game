More tasks:

- add lots more unit tests (using pytest)

- add more shell-level testing:
	- add remaining files in "boards/"
	- gen all "solutions/" files
	- validate the solutions are correct
	- write a script to compare actual w/ reference solutions
	- add a few cases that have no solutions

- add a check to fail the solve branch if a non-queened group is fully blocked
	(verify actually faster)
- check for the case where free cells of two groups cover same two
	rows (or cols), then block all other groups in those rows/cols
	(verify actually faster)
- use 4 types of groups (add neighborhoods), try to regularize
	the code, add links from each cell to the 4 groups it determines
- maybe don't bother caching free-counts, to simplify code
